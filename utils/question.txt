(I am learning English, so please excuse my English)

```nim
import strutils
import sequtils

let N = 10
let S = "grape banana tomato"
let A = newSeqWith(N, S.split)
echo A
```
I know split has 2 patterns, iterator and procedure.
In this pattern, I thought the split was executed as as procedure.
why do i get a error?
```txt
Error: type mismatch: got 'seq[string]' for 'split(S, {' ', '\t', '\v', '\r', '\n', '\f'}, -1)' but expected 'string'
```
